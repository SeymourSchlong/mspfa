# What is a footer image?

It's the randomized image at the bottom-left corner of MSPFA.

# Can I get a template?

Here you go.

![Template](https://mspfa.com/images/footers/template.png)

If you want to upload your own footer image, it should match the template in size, general style, that it's mostly desaturated, and that it can't be too distracting if it's animated.

The format of the filenames of any footer images should be your username, followed by an underscore, ending with a number to identify your image. The number should be "1" if it's the first image under your username, "2" if it's the second, and so on. The number increases per file regardless of file format. Here's a filename example of if someone under the username "nixshadow" were to upload their fourth footer image.

`nixshadow_4.png`

Lastly, only PNGs and GIFs are accepted.

# How can I upload mine?

* Once you have your image or images, double-check to make sure they follow the template and its respective requirements, which can be found above.
* Create a GitHub account on this website if you haven't already, and log in.
* At the top-right corner of this page, click the "Fork" button to make an editable copy of MSPFA you can upload to on GitHub.
* Once it's done loading, go to "public", then "images", and then "footers", and click "Upload files", obviously to upload your files.
* After uploading your desired footer image or images, click "Commit changes" at the bottom and wait for it to finish loading.
* Click the link that says "Pull request", which can be found above the file list and to the right.
* Click the big button that says "Create pull request".
* Now that any admins have been notified of your request, you can wait for them to verify it, or to comment on it if there is a reason that the request is unacceptable. It is recommended that you check on the request's status frequently to await verification or comments. Alternatively, you can tell an admin about the pull request on [Discord](https://discord.mspfa.com/) if you want to speed up the process.

If you want to edit an image from a pull request you've already made, follow these steps instead.

* In your pull request, go to "public", then "images", and then "footers", and find the image or images you previously uploaded in GitHub's file list.
* For each image you are editing, click on it, press the deletion icon in the top-right corner, and click "Commit changes".
* After doing this for each applicable image, click "Upload files" and upload the edited images from your computer.
* Click "Commit changes".
* Wait for additional verification from an admin.
